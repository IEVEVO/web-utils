# Welcome

This is the hub for iNet's UI Utilities - a series of simple Pure Javascript \(no jQuery\) solutions to some simple interface problems.

Each utility has its own set of files in order to be as modular and lightweight as possible, as you only load the files you need.

Full documentation can be found [here](https://inet.gitbook.io/inet-ui-utils/).
