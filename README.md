# Welcome

This is the hub for iNet's UI Utilities - a series of simple Pure Javascript \(no jQuery\) solutions to some simple interface problems.

Each utility has its own set of files in order to be as modular and lightweight as possible, as you only load the files you need.

Full documentation can be found [here](https://inet.gitbook.io/inet-ui-utils/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that this is not supposed to be the most efficient way to do any of these things, but rather an easy way to set something up with minimal knowledge of Javascript and the like.

There are _definitely_ more efficient ways to go about writing these if you're into that, but to do so would somewhat sacrifice the "plug-and-play" system I was going for.
